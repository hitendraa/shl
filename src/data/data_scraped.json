            "Description": "This report is more or less identical to the standard MFS report but with an additional section that looks at the performance versus the potential and plots the competencies on a four field grid to identify developed strengths, natural strengths, development need, or untapped potential.  The report text has been updated to reflect the inclusion of the OPQ, and the potential is also shown in the competency summary part of the report. The OPQ scores that feed into this report will need to be uploaded into MFS using an upload sheet based on a score extract from SODA or TC. This particular example report also includes development tips which are an optional extra.",

SHL can also offer support and training throughout the entire process, from defining objectives through interpreting and delivering the feedback.  360 feedback serves all levels and industries and is a positive and powerful addition to your performance management system.",

Links the essential/desirable competencies for a specific job with an individual’s competency potential. Provides an overall Match (or fit) Score useful in ranking/sorting candidates for selection \r\nand/or development (e.g. Talent Audit).  It provides a highly visual profile of a candidate's strengths and limitations against identified required competencies. Includes a summary table that enables prioritisation of action planning for development of critical competencies for an individual (by tabling Competency Potential against Job Importance for the role). It includes highly descriptive statements about a candidate's strengths and development  needs/limitations. \r\nThe extended report versions include proposed competency-based interview questions \r\nto enable probing of specific situations in which the candidate might have \r\ndemonstrated critical job behaviours. \r\n  \r\nThe PJM Report is designed for use by line managers and HR professionals in selection and \r\ndevelopment situations. It is valuable for identifying an individual's overall fit as well as likely areas of \r\nstrength and weakness relative to their behaviour at work. \r\n \r\nIn a selection context, this information can be used: For making interviewers aware of the areas that may need further probing. As a basis for suggesting and creating relevant interview questions. For identifying the relative strengths and weaknesses of shortlisted candidates.",

The behaviors vary in the extent to which the sales associate may: direct a conversation toward a commitment or sale, listen carefully to customers and provide options that address what they really need/want, put aside work to assist a customer, and focus on meeting customer needs. Responses are tracked and compared against expert ratings of effectiveness. The test produces an overall score, as well as scores on two subscales, Customer Service Effectiveness and Sales Effectiveness.",

This test is comprised of items that contain a passage that must read in order to answer the question being asked. The questions focus on the ability to demonstrate an understanding of the passage. Questions may be specific in nature, with answers that can be found almost word for word in the passage. For example, the question may ask for a date, name or place that can be found by closely reading through the passage. Alternatively, the questions may be general in nature, with answers that can be determined only by fully understanding the meaning of the passage. \"What is the theme of the passage?\" or \"What is the mood of the author?\" are examples of general questions that may be asked.",

This solution is designed for contact center roles that involve sales or sales-related behaviors such as recommending products or services and retaining customers. Sample tasks for these jobs include: interact with customers on the phone to sell a product/service; add new or upgraded products or services; extend promotional or retention offers; respond appropriately to customer objections; navigate to information menus to assist the customer and process information; and type information quickly and accurately. Potential job titles that use this simulation are: Telesales Representative, Telemarketer, and Contact Center Representative. The behavioral tests in this solution are intended to measure the candidate’s sales focus, learning potential, and the tendency to meet goals and work hard, even when faced with obstacles. Collectively, the assessments in this solution measure a wide range of important skills, abilities, and behaviors for entry-level contact center roles involving sales or sales and service.",

As with all assessments included in the Verify suite, the Technical Checking assessment allows organizations to assess this aspect of cognitive ability in an unproctored setting. This assessment is appropriate for all job levels and job titles, but is especially relevant for jobs that require the ability to quickly assess the accuracy of information against a set of rules.",
